# cvnavigator

This application was developed between 2009 and 2012 as I participated in a startup company named CVnavigator. The company home page still exists here: http://www.cvnav.com/ and the online version of the web application can be found here http://cvnav2.dk/Public/Welcome.aspx

The application was developed using C# 3.0, NHibernate, MS SQL Server, jQuery and other javascript libraries.
