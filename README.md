# cvnavigator

This application was developed between 2009 and 2012 as I participated in a startup company named CVnavigator. The company home page still exists here: http://www.cvnav.com/ and the online version of the web application can be found here http://cvnav2.dk/Public/Welcome.aspx

The application was developed using C# 3.0, NHibernate, MS SQL Server, jQuery and other javascript libraries. 

As the code is now owned by another company, I have only exposed two modules out of 50 modules making up the whole platform. For the same reason the code cannot be compiled or executed as is.
